# Assignment 3: Java Web API Creation With Hibernate

For this assignment, as we understand it, we need to create a database (seeded with dummy data)
and implement Swagger where we can use CRUD functions. The database consist of a Franchise, Movies and Characters (we
chose Star Wars as our reference material) with relationships.
We are also to put the application in a Dockerfile and deploy it on Heroku

## How To Use

To use the application, run it and in the browser go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
-Using Swagger you can use Create, Read, Update & Delete to interact with the database and use
Get all to get all characters in a movie or get all movies in a franchise.

## Future
Future work may include:
- front-end to add to the database.
